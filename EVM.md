# Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)
The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is a software environment that runs on the Ethereum blockchain. It is responsible for executing smart contracts on the Ethereum network. The EVM is a virtual machine that runs on the nodes of the Ethereum network and is responsible for enforcing the rules of the Ethereum protocol, including the execution of smart contracts.

Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code. These contracts are stored on the blockchain, which allows them to be executed automatically when certain conditions are met. The EVM is responsible for executing these smart contracts, ensuring that they are executed according to the rules of the Ethereum protocol.

One of the key features of the EVM is that it is a Turing-complete virtual machine, which means that it can execute any program. This allows for the creation of a wide range of decentralized applications (dApps) on the Ethereum network. dApps are applications that run on the blockchain and can range from simple games to complex financial applications.

The EVM also has its own programming language, called Solidity, which is used to write smart contracts on the Ethereum network. Solidity is a contract-oriented, high-level language that is similar to JavaScript. It is designed to be easy to learn and use, making it accessible to developers of all skill levels.

The EVM also includes a gas system, which is used to pay for the execution of smart contracts on the network. Gas is a form of cryptocurrency that is used to pay for the computational resources required to execute smart contracts on the Ethereum network. The amount of gas required for a particular contract will depend on the complexity of the contract and the amount of data that needs to be processed.

In summary, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is a software environment that runs on the Ethereum blockchain and is responsible for executing smart contracts, enforcing the rules of the Ethereum protocol, and providing a platform for decentralized applications (dApps). The EVM provides a Turing-complete environment and its own programming language, Solidity, and gas system to pay for the execution of smart contracts on the network.
