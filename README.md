# Major issues on Ethereum Network
The Ethereum network faces several major issues, which include:

Scalability: As mentioned earlier, scalability is a major issue for the Ethereum network, as the current limitations of scalability can lead to delays and high fees during periods of high network congestion.

Security: Smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement written into lines of code, are vulnerable to hacking and malicious attacks. In the past, several high-profile smart contract vulnerabilities have been exploited, resulting in significant financial losses.

Governance: Decentralization is one of the core principles of the Ethereum network, but it can also make it difficult to make changes to the network. The Ethereum community is still figuring out the best way to govern the network and make decisions that are in the best interest of the community as a whole.

Environmental impact: The Ethereum network currently uses a Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism which is energy-intensive, and this has led to concerns about the environmental impact of the network. Ethereum is currently in the process of transitioning to a more energy-efficient Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism which should reduce the environmental impact of the network.

Adoption: While Ethereum has a large and active developer community, the network is still in the early stages of adoption. Many of the proposed solutions and use cases for the network are still in development, and it remains to be seen how widely the network will
